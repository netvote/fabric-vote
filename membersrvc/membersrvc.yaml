                # The 'registrar' section is used to control access to registration of new users directly via the ECAA.RegisterUser GRPC call.

                #
                # Only users with a 'registrar' section may be a registrar to register other users.  In particular,
                # 1) the "roles" field specifies which member roles may be registered by this user, and
                # 2) the "delegateRoles" field specifies which member roles may become the "roles" field of registered users.

                # Example1:
                #    The 'admin' user below can register clients, peers, validators, or auditors; furthermore, the 'admin' user can register other
                #    users who can then register clients only.
                #
                # Example2:
                #    The 'WebAppAdmin' user below can register clients only, but none of the users registered by this user can register other users.
